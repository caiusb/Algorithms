\paragraph{Encoding the problem statement in terms of assignment problems}

Let $N$ be the set of all devices.

Let $(x, y)$ with $ x, y \in N$ be backup pairs where device $x$ is backed up by device $y$. It follows that that two devices can form a backup pair only if they are in distance of each other, $d[x, y] \leq D$.

Let $S$ be a valid backup scheme. Then $S = \{(x_S, y_S) | x_S, y_S \in N \}$ where the following constraints hold:

\begin{itemize}

\item Device $x_S$ must be backed up exactly $k$ times: $c(x_S) = k$.

\item All devices must be backed up: $\bigcup_{x_S \in N} x_s = N $

\item Device $y_S$ must backup at most $b$ devices: $c(y_S) \leq b$.

\item Device $y_S$ can either backup $x_S$ or not: $c(x_S, y_S) \leq 1$.

\end{itemize}
