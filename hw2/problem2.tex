\problem{2}
Given a set $C$ of $n$ circles in the plane, each specified by its radius $r$ and the coordinates of its center $(x, y)$, we set out to find a minimum set of rays from the origin $(0, 0)$ that will intersect every circle.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item We define a circle's \emph{angular range} to be the angles at which a ray fired from the origin will intersect that circle. We define a circle's \emph{highest angle} as the highest angle in its angular range (with respect to a ray that we define as having angle 0, with angles increasing in a counterclockwise direction).
	
	Given the condition that there exists a ray from the origin which does not intersect any circles in $C$, we can define the following algorithm.
	
	\begin{algorithm}
		\caption{}
		\label{rays-circles1}
		\begin{algorithmic}
			\State Set a ray from (0, 0) which does not intersect any circles in $C$ to be angle 0.
			\State $L \gets$ $C$ sorted by highest angle
			\State $m \gets 0$
			\While{$L$ is not empty}
				\State Shoot ray $R_{m}$ at highest angle of first circle in $L$
				\State Delete from $L$ all circles intersected by $R_{m}$
				\State $m \gets m+1$
			\EndWhile
			\Return $m$
		\end{algorithmic}
	\end{algorithm}
	\item
\end{enumerate}
